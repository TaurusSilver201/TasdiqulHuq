My work for EDGE (Enhancing Digital Government and Economy) which is a project of the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) under the ICT Division.
EDGE Project works on creating the enabling environment for digital government and the digital economy.
The project, funded by World Bank and GoB, will ensure an integrated, cloud-computing digital platform for all government agencies and improve cyber-security, which will result in savings of $200 million in the public sector's IT investments.Further, it will build resiliency during future crises, whereby the platform will enable the government to operate virtually and deliver critical public services to citizens and businesses.
